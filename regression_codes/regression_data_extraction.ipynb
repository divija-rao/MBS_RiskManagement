    "### Target Variable (to be derived):\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Current Loan Delinquency Status*: The number of days the borrower is delinquent in making loan payments as of the end of the monthly reporting period. Used to derive the target (e.g., delinquent if >0). Guide notes: 0 = Current, 1 = 30-59 days, 2 = 60-89 days, ..., RA = Repayment Plan, RF = REO, 999 = Unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictor Variables (Features):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From Origination Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Credit Score*: The standardized credit score used to evaluate the borrower during the loan origination process. Lower scores indicate higher risk. Guide notes: FICO score, masked as 300 for <300, 850 for >850, or 9999 for missing.\n",
    "- *Original Combined Loan-to-Value (CLTV)*: The ratio of the original loan amount and any subordinate lien amount to the property value at origination. Higher ratios increase default risk. Guide notes: Rounded to nearest integer, 999 for missing.\n",
    "- *Original Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio*: The ratio of the borrower's total monthly debt payments to gross monthly income at origination. Higher DTI suggests financial strain. Guide notes: Rounded to nearest integer, 999 for missing or not considered.\n",
    "- *Original Interest Rate*: The interest rate on the loan as stated on the note at the time the loan was originated. Higher rates may lead to higher payments and defaults. Guide notes: Reported to the nearest eighth of a percent.\n",
    "- *Original Loan Term*: The number of months in which the loan is scheduled to be repaid. Longer terms may reduce monthly payments but increase long-term risk. Guide notes: In months, e.g., 360 for 30-year loans.\n",
    "- *Number of Borrowers*: The number of borrowers who are obligated to repay the mortgage note. Multiple borrowers may reduce risk. Guide notes: 99 for missing.\n",
    "- *Property State*: The two-letter postal abbreviation for the state in which the property is located. Captures regional economic factors. Guide notes: U.S. states only.\n",
    "- *Occupancy Status*: The classification for the property occupancy status at the time the loan was originated. Investment properties have higher risk. Guide notes: O = Owner Occupied, S = Second Home, I = Investment Property, 9 = Unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From Performance Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Loan Age*: The number of scheduled monthly payments that have elapsed since the loan was originated. Helps capture loan seasoning. Guide notes: In months, 999 for missing.\n",
    "- *Remaining Months to Legal Maturity*: The number of months remaining until the loan is scheduled to mature. Shorter terms may indicate higher risk near maturity. Guide notes: In months, 999 for missing.\n",
    "- *Current Actual UPB*: The unpaid principal balance of the loan as of the end of the monthly reporting period. Higher UPB may correlate with defaults. Guide notes: Rounded to nearest $1,000, 000000 for zero balance.\n",
    "- *Current Interest Rate*: The interest rate on the loan as of the end of the monthly reporting period. Adjustments can affect affordability. Guide notes: Reported to the nearest eighth of a percent, 99.999 for missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale for Selection: \n",
    "\n",
    "These variables cover borrower creditworthiness, loan affordability, property details, and ongoing performance, which are key drivers of default risk. The target is derived from 'Current Loan Delinquency Status' as a binary flag (1 for delinquent, 0 for current).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Identifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Loan Sequence Number*: A unique identifier for each loan, critical for merging and tracking across origination and performance data. Guide notes: 12-character alphanumeric, masked for privacy.\n",
    "- *Original Loan-to-Value (LTV)*: The ratio of the original loan amount to the property value at origination, providing additional context to Original Combined Loan-to-Value (CLTV). Guide notes: Rounded to nearest integer, 999 for missing.\n",
    "- *First Payment Date*: The date of the first scheduled payment, offering a temporal anchor for loan age and performance. Guide notes: Format YYYYMMDD, parsed as datetime64[ns]."
